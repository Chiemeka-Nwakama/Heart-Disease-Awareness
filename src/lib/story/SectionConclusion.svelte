	<h3>What We Learned</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Lifestyle is huge:</strong> Your daily habits and tendencies
			can play significant roles in your heart health.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Demographics matter:</strong> Age, gender, and race all
			shape risk in significant ways. Men face higher rates than women
			until older age, and certain racial/ethnic groups experience
			disproportionately higher rates due to a complex mix of genetic,
			social, and healthcare access factors.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Where you live can tilt the odds:</strong> Geographic
			location matters beyond individual choices. States with lower
			heart disease rates tend to have better healthcare infrastructure,
			more walkable communities, and greater access to healthy food
			options.
		</li>

	<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
	<p>
		Heart health is complex, shaped by a web of factors from our
		daily habits to where we were born. But data helps us see what we
		can actually control.
	</p>

	<p>
		While we can't change our age, family history, or easily
		relocate, we <em>can</em> modify our lifestyle choices. The evidence
		is clear: regular exercise, nutritious eating, adequate sleep, and
		avoiding smoking make a substantial difference.
	</p>

	<p>
		Understanding these patterns isn't just about statistics; it's
		about empowering each of us to make informed choices that can add
		years to our lives and life to our years.
